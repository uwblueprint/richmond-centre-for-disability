        <p>
          Accessible parking is governed by the Motor Vehicle Act which defines a person with a
          disability as a person whose mobility is limited as a result of a permanent or temporary
          disability that makes it impossible or difficult to walk.

            RCD Accessible Parking Permit Program
          </NewTabLink>{' '}
          valid permit holders can park in a designated accessible parking space anywhere in B.C.,
          elsewhere in Canada or even outside of Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the Rules of Use of the Accessible Parking Permit Program in B.C. the permit has
          been designed to travel with the eligible permit holder and can be used in any vehicle.
          This means that someone with a mobility-related disability might benefit from having a
          permit even if they do not own a vehicle or no longer drive.
        </p>
        <p>
          To successfully use your permit, you must display your permit by hanging it from your
          rear-view mirror. You will also be issued a wallet card which you must carry with you to
          confirm that you are the valid permit holder.

    question: 'If I qualify for a parking permit, will I have to reapply?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>There are two types of parking permits for people with disabilities:</p>
        <p>
          Permanent permits are valid for three (3) years at which time you can renew your permit
          for an additional three years. Permit renewals for permanent permits can be renewed
          online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temporary permits are valid for a period of one month to one year. Upon expiration, you
          may reapply with a new application form signed by a medical professional for a new permit.

          expire. This is applicable to all permanent permit holders. Once you receive your renewal
          notice you can renew your permit online, over the phone or by mailing in your completed
          renewal form. There is a processing fee to renew your permit (fee is $31 as at August
          2023). As well, we ask that you also return your expired permit.

    question: 'What happens if I continue to use an expired permit?',
    answer: (

        <p>
          Your parking permit has a registration number that is unique to you. It also has an expiry
          date that shows the month and year that your permit will expire. If you continue to use an
          expired permit, you are at risk of a fine and/or in some instances it is possible that
          your vehicle could even be towed. All such cost incurred will be your own responsibility.
          For permanent permit holders, we will send you one (1) renewal form a month ahead that
          your permit is up for renewal.

        <p>
          Having a RCD Accessible Parking Permit is a service that we provide for eligible people
          with disabilities in B.C. Having a parking permit does not automatically make you a member
          of the RCD. However, many of our parking permit holders have indicated that they would
          like to join RCD and become a member as a way of continuing to help to keep the Accessible
          Parking Permit Program strong and to support our work with people and communities with
          disabilities across British Columbia.

    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          If you are visiting British Columbia and have a valid parking permit in your home country,
          agreements are in place to ensure that you may enjoy the same rights and privileges here
          as you do in your home country. Please contact us to let us know about the details of your
          trip and we can help by issuing a temporary permit that is recognized in B.C. To obtain a
          temporary permit, you will need to present official documentation from the issuing agency
          in your country. This information is needed to help to confirm that you are a valid
          accessible parking permit holder in your home jurisdiction. There is a Canadian processing
          fee for any permit issued (fee is $31 as at August 2023).

        <p>
          Working in partnership with the Provincial Accessibility Secretariat, ICBC, and the
          Ministry of Transportation, RCD has also created a parking permit for existing valid
          permit holders who ride a motorcycle. This permit is in the form of a decal which can be
          affixed to the windscreen or to the front of your motorcycle. This permit will be updated
          every year upon request (at no cost) and is available to all current valid permit holders
          who ride a motorcycle.

        <p>
          Every year RCD receives more than 8,000 calls and process more than 3,000 permits. Your
          processing fee helps to cover the cost of delivering the program and helps to keep the
          Accessible Parking Permit Program strong. It is also worth noting that we deliver this
          valuable community service across British Columbia without any funding from government. It
          is all done through the processing fee that you pay as well as any donations that you
          make. As well, we have an established policy that hardship assistance is available upon
          request to anyone who does not have the economic resources to cover the cost of the
          processing fee. Processing fee is $31 as at August 2023.
