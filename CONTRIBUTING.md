# Contributions

## New Contributors
Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this repo! This project is actively in use with our clients and requires the help of volunteers like yourself to maintain and continue to foster this project’s growth. Every contribution helps and credit is always given!

To get started contributing to this project, please email <bpsf@gmail.com>. An exec on the team will send you a Slack invite and will onboard you onto our project.

# Roles
We have two roles on the maintenance team: Blueprint Software Foundation (BSF) executive and contributors.

## Blueprint Software Foundation executive member
BSF is an overarching organization responsible for the upkeep of projects shipped by UW Blueprint. As of writing, BSF is composed of 3 executives: 2 alumni and a UW Blueprint president. 

Executives are responsible for maintaining communications with clients and with UW Blueprint regarding maintenance projects and onboarding new projects onto BSF.  They are also responsible for coordinating work on tasks/issues and onboarding contributors.

## Contributors
Much of the fruitful maintenance and upkeep work on projects will be due to our wonderful contributors! Contributors will work with execs in prioritizing and planning maintenance work and shipping the work to our clients. As of writing, **contributors will be sourced from UW Blueprint alumni** but we are planning on opening up contributions to those not part of UW Blueprint.

# Contribution workflow
Please follow the following steps in order to productively contribute to this repository.

## Step 1: Fork the repo
On the repository’s main page, click ‘Fork Repo’ at the top of the page. 

## Step 2: Configure your environment
Once you have Notion access, take a look at the README.md file, [development guidelines](https://www.notion.so/uwblueprintexecs/Development-processes-a0313f2bef9941fc8752c8e7b5be5e70) and [engineering best practices](https://www.notion.so/uwblueprintexecs/READ-Best-Practices-Engineering-3174edea363b4d4896af8dfc461cfd9c) to set up your environment.

## Step 3: Connect with people
As mentioned above, if you are not already on our Slack, please email <bpsf@gmail.com>. Once added, please talk to the execs on which issues or features are highest priority. This will be available as a Notion board as well.

Once an issue is chosen, discuss with fellow contributors and execs on Slack on how you plan on approaching the issues. We will subsequently assign you the issue and you can get cracking!

## Step 4: Prepare PR
Clone your fork locally and start to make your changes. Small changes are always greater than huge, breaking changes! Make sure that you test a variety of situations before you push your change to your fork!

## Step 5: Pass PR review
Once you feel confident that your change addresses the issue/feature spec, sync your fork with the main repository and open up a PR on the main repo from your fork. Please provide a detailed description of your change and ask for the reviews of an exec/designated contributor.

Please be cognizant of an executive’s relatively limited time. Reviews may take longer than you would expect! Use Slack wisely to ensure that you can get a review in a timely manner.
